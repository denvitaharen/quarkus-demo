# Quarkus demo
This is an demo of two microservices using Quarkus.

Its based around the problem that you need to calculate how many hours that you need to run your engine heater at an given temperature.

The demo is mainly based in the engine-heater microservice and tries to use so many features as possible to show the capabilites of Quarkus.

## What you need
For this to run you have to use:
- Some sort of Docker enviroment or switch from Postgres DB to H2
- Optional: Prometheus and Grafana too show dashes.
